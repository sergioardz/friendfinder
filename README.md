## Demo
![FriendFinder](https://github.com/sergioardz/friendfinder/blob/master/FriendFinder.gif)

## What the project does

Friend Finder is a compatibility based application. Once a user fills a survey with some personality type questions, this **full-stack** site will take the results and compare answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Why the project is useful

This is the first **full-stack** application using express and also the first one being deployed in Heroku from my Work.

## How does it works

At the HomePage of the user will find a Go to Survey button and also links to: 
* 1) API with JSON Friend List and 
* 2) This GitHub Repo.

At the Survey Page the user will need to start by filling in their name as a well as the path to a picture. Just after that the user will need to start filling out the answers to 10 personality questions by using the drop down options and/or the search filter option built with in. Once the survey is complete the user can submit the information and at that time the app will disply the best match based on thier answers.

## How can I use it

There are two ways to test this:

* The easy way: just go to the app and test it [Friend Finder](https://powerful-shore-71760.herokuapp.com/)
* The not that easy way: you would need to clone/download the repository and install the necessary dependencies with the command “npm install”.
