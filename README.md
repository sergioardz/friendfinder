## Demo
![FriendFinder](https://github.com/sergioardz/friendfinder/blob/master/FriendFinder.gif)

## Overview
In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

### Fill out the questions and try the site!

## friendfinder details - What the project does  
As stated in the overview, this is the first Full-Stack site created by this humble coder.  
It is a pretty basic but cool site which has a form with a few questions for a user to submit, once the user submit the form, the server will process the information and compare it to the already saved profiles of the site. And using a matching methodology it would find the user's their best match. In addition the site contains a basic API with all saved profiles information.

## friendfinder's Purpose - Why the project is useful  
From a developer standpoint, friendfinder wraps and reinforce the concepts learned during week 13.  

From a user standpoint, friendfinder helps you find a potential good fiend or even your better half.
